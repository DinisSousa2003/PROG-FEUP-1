Changed variable inst to an integer, as we want to input integer in the menu.
Created a prototype of a function that handles integer intputs.
Function to go from inst to game_state.
I don't understand the purpose of readInst() function being on main(), as we read the instruction on the menu, and the game instruction on the game.
(the function is there, just commented)
Function exit works from the menu.
N├úo sei o que dizer nas regras amigo Dinis!! - Changed this to english, acentos bugaite terminal.

smth on showRules() erases
On showRules() function added a back button ("1") to end the loop and return to menu, now we can go back and foward to path for rules
Maybe redo check input function with a loop instead recursion, bc efficiency (not a big deal)
Just an ideia but we could use -game_state- as a parameter to avoid use global variables
Added - system("CLS") - with <stdlib.h>, that cleans all the the user view:

Dinis: (01/04/2021)
function that reads map from file (still to improve)
TO DO: get the tingys in the map_vector. (anyway, the code that is there can be deleted)

Malva: (02/04/2021)
mapmap_vector can now be read from files <.txt>
added readMap() (a void function), that outputs the map for the user's view, at any time, recieving <map_vector, n_lines, n_colums>
changed importMap, now returns a map vector instead of void
applied read.map() in play() fuction
system("CLS") now clears buffer when menu, rules or play functions are called
started game play <search for 'game play' and u'll see it>, not mutch bc is late 

Both: (05/05/2021)
Reading map now works both for XX and X format.
Input game action improved.
TO DO: 
->implement function to work with cntrl-z
->input must work only one at a time (no premoves and shit)
->start working on nerdy robot movement
