Changed variable inst to an integer, as we want to input integer in the menu.
Created a prototype of a function that handles integer intputs.
Function to go from inst to game_state.
I don't understand the purpose of readInst() function being on main(), as we read the instruction on the menu, and the game instruction on the game.
(the function is there, just commented)
Function exit works from the menu.
